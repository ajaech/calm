Context Aware Language Models

Code for building language models that adapt to different contexts. This code was written to support the experiments in the paper 
[Improving Context Aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06380). Read the paper for a description of the model.

Train a model using 
`
./rnnlm.py path/to/expdir --data ../data/smallreddit.tsv 
`
I will work on documenting the code more. Send me a message if you want some help getting started.
